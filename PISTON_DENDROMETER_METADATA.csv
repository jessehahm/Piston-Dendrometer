Sagehorn,205,QUGA,S,NE,7,2,1,8/6/2015,18:49,3,,50000,,,,"We scraped away what we interpreted to be dead bark to reveal live bark, identified by a color change (typically darker to lighter), increase in moisture content (wet), and fibrous texture. We placed the pistond dendrometer on the outermost live bark."
Sagehorn,205,QUGA,S,SW,27,4,2,8/6/2015,18:49,3,Threaded rods not srewed in all the way (yet). Screwed all the way in 9-AUG-2015,50001,,,,"We threaded rods approximately 15 cm in total length into the tree after pre-drilling to approximately 8 cm. The idea is to sink the end of the threaded rod into the dead heartwood of the tree, to fix the piston dendrometer in a tree frame of reference."
